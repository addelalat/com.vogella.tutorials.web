[[canvas]]
== Canvas

HTML5
introduces the <canvas> </canvas>
element which is a black element on which you can draw in real time
via JavaScript. Canvas has the advantages that as it is part of the
HTML specification all browser will support it directly without the
need to install a plugin. Currently canvas only supports 2D rendering
but 3D rendering is planned for the future.

Create for example the following page which draws on the canvas
a rectangle.
