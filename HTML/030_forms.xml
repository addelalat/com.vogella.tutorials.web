== Forms
	
		Forms are used to capture input from the user. The input of a
		form is
		usually receive by a server side program which will receive
		the input
		from the form and can then process the data. In the <![CDATA[ <input> ]]>
		tag you define via the "type" attribute defines the expected type.
		HTML5 defines lots of possible types, unfortunately currently most of
		them are not supported by most browsers. If a browser does not
		recognize a certain type it will assume text. So it is save to use the
		types. Here is a form with some input fields.
