	<title>XHTML</title>
	<para>
		XHTML is similar to HTML but much stricter. XHTML defines the
		following strict requirements:

		• Write all code in lowercase letters
		•
		Encase all attribute values in double quotes
		• Each tag must have an
		end specified. This is normally
		done with an ending tag, but a special
		case allows for
		non-content tags.

	<para> In HTML5 the MIME-type determines if the HTLM is strict XML or
		standard HTML. A document served as "text/html" must be a HTML document, and a document served with
		an XML MIME type such as "application/xhtml+xml" must conform to the
		requirements of HML.</para>
