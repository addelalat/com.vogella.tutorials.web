	<title>XHTML
	
		XHTML is similar to HTML but much stricter. XHTML defines the
		following strict requirements:

		• Write all code in lowercase letters
		•
		Encase all attribute values in double quotes
		• Each tag must have an
		end specified. This is normally
		done with an ending tag, but a special
		case allows for
		non-content tags.

			*Each HTML files must define its doctype    
			
			*All attribute values must be in double quotes 
			
			*Each tag must have an end specified.     
			
		
	
	 In HTML5 the MIME-type determines if the HTLM is strict XML or
		standard HTML. A document served as "text/html" must be a HTML document, and a document served with
		an XML MIME type such as "application/xhtml+xml" must conform to the
		requirements of HML.
