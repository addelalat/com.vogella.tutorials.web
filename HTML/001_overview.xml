		<title>What is HTML?
		
			HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is a standard to describe the
			content of webpages. HTML pages are
			text files which typically end
			with
			the ".html" extension. HTML is a
			<wordasword>markup language</wordasword>
			.
		
		
			The
			current version of HTML is HTML5. HTML5
			supports XML syntax.
			This tutorial uses the HTML5 XML syntax.
		

		
			In HTML you describe the
			content in pure text, by
			defining
			text
			as
			headings,
			paragraphs, lists, etc. A tag is a text
			surrounded by
			angle
			brackets. Tags usually have a
			beginning and end
			and
			contain
			other text
			between the start and end
			tag. The normal content
			of
			the webpage is
			placed between the <![CDATA[ <body> </body> ]]>
			tags, the <![CDATA[ <head> </head> ]]>
			tag contains general information about the webpage.

		<title>A structured example
		
			HTML5 introduced several new ways of classifying content of the
			webpage, e.g., <![CDATA[ <nav> </nav> ]]>
			for the navigation part of the page, <![CDATA[ <article>  ]]>
			to represent an independent article,<![CDATA[ <aside> </aside> ]]>
			to represent a sidebar with related information.<![CDATA[ <footer> </footer> ]]>
			for a footer in the HTML page and <![CDATA[ <address> </address> ]]>
			for the contact information of the author.
		
		
			The following displays an example which uses these new
			elements. Most
			browser will not change the display based on them but
			you can use
			<ulink url="http://www.vogella.com/tutorials/CSS/article.html"> CSS</ulink>
			to select these elements and style them accordingly.
		
		
			<programlisting>
				<xi:include xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude"
					parse="text" href="./examples/structure/example.html" />
			</programlisting>
