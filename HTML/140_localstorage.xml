== Local storage
	
		HTML5 supports local storage of data to work offline. Currently you
		find:

		
			*
				Web storage/ Local storage: key / Value storage, supported by
					most recent
					browsers, no transactions
			
			*
				WEb SQL Database: Full database in the browser
			
			*
				IndexedDB: Similar to Web storage but you can index on certain
					fields 
			
			*
				File API: Allows to store files on the local file system
				
			
		

	

	
		Currently it is recommended to use local storage as it has the largest
		support. For an example see
