			Download the Jersey distribution as zip file from the
https://jersey.java.net/download.html">Jersey download site]
			.
		

		
			The zip contains the Jersey implementation JAR and its
			core
			dependencies. It does
			not provide
			dependencies for third
			party JARs
			beyond those for
			JSON support
			and JavaDoc.
		
		
			Copy all JARs from your Jersey download into the
			<filename class="directory">WEB-INF/lib`
			folder.
