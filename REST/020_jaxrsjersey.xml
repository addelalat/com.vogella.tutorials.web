			Java defines REST support via the
			<wordasword>Java Specification Request (JSR)</wordasword>
			311. This specification is called
			JAX-RS (The Java API for
			RESTful
			Web
			Services).
			JAX-RS uses annotations
			to define the REST relevance of
			Java

			The

			webservices in a Java servlet container.
		</para>
		<para>
			On the server side Jersey provides a servlet implementation which
			scans predefined
			classes to identify RESTful resources.
			In your
			<filename>web.xml</filename>
			configuration file your register this servlet for your web
			application.
		</para>
		<para>
			The Jersey implementation also provides a client
			library to
			communicate with
			a RESTful webservice.

		</para>
		<para>
			This servlet analyzes the incoming HTTP request and
			selects
			the
			correct class and method to respond to this request. This
			selection
			is
			based on annotations in the class and methods.
		</para>
		<para>
			A REST web application consists, therefore, out of data classes
			(resources)
			and
			services. These two types are typically maintained in
			different
			packages as the Jersey servlet will be instructed via the
			<filename>web.xml</filename>
			to
			scan certain packages for data classes.

			JAX-RS
			supports the creation of XML and JSON via
			the Java
			Architecture for
			XML Binding (JAXB).

					<tbody>
						<row>
							<entry>@PATH(your_path)</entry>
							<entry>
								Sets the path to base URL + /your_path. The base URL is
								based on
								your application name, the servlet and the URL pattern
								from the
								<filename>web.xml</filename>
								configuration file.
							</entry>
						</row>
						<row>
							<entry>@POST</entry>
							<entry>
								Indicates that the following method will answer to an HTTP
								POST
								request.
							</entry>

							<entry>@GET</entry>
							<entry>
								Indicates that the following method will answer to an HTTP
								GET
								request.

							<entry>@PUT</entry>
							<entry>
								Indicates that the following method will answer to an HTTP
								PUT

								Indicates that the following method will answer to an HTTP
								DELETE
								request.
							</entry>
						</row>
						<row>
							<entry>@Produces(MediaType.TEXT_PLAIN[, more-types])</entry>
							<entry>
								@Produces defines which MIME type is delivered by a method
								annotated with @GET. In the example text ("text/plain") is
								produced. Other examples would be "application/xml" or
								"application/json".
							</entry>

							<entry>@Consumes(type[, more-types])</entry>
							<entry>
								@Consumes defines which MIME type is consumed by this
								method.
							</entry>
						</row>
						<row>
							<entry>@PathParam</entry>
							<entry>
								Used to inject values from the URL into a method
								parameter.
								This way you inject, for example, the ID of a resource
								into the method to get the correct object.
