== Using Eclipse
	 You can also use Eclipse for developing GAE applications via the
		PyDev plugin.

	<section id="eclipse_pydev">
=== Eclipse and Pydev
		
			Please see
http://www.vogella.com/tutorials/Python/article.html"> Python Development with Eclipse</ulink>
			to learn how to install and use Eclipse and Pydev. The remaining
			focuses on the additional setup to use the GAE.
		

	<section id="eclipse_project">
=== Project

		
			Create a Python project called "de.vogella.gae.python.todo". See
http://www.vogella.com/tutorials/Python/article.html"> Python Development with Eclipse</ulink>
			for how to create a new Pydev / Python project in Eclipse.
		
		 Use Python version 2.5. Remember that the GAE does currently
			only support Python version 2.5
		 Copy the content of the directory from the previous example
			(all your files and directeries): todo.py, app.yam, index.html)into
			the source folder.

=== Make GAE SDK available
		 We need to add the GAE SDK to the pythonpath. Right-click your
			project and select properties. Select PYTHONPATH and press "Add
			source folder" in the "External Source Folder". Select the
			installation directory of the GAE SDK. Also add lib/django,
			lib/webob
			and lib/yaml

	<section id="eclipse_run">
=== Run your application
		 You still can use the command line to run your GAE application.
			But we are now going to configure Eclipse to allow you to run your
			application directly from Eclipse.
		 Right-click on "todo.py", select Run As -> Run Configuration.
			Under Main Module maintain the path to dev_appserver.py

		 Switch to the argument tab and maintain the full path name of
			your project as a parameter. Put the parameter in double-quotes.

		 Click run to start your application. If you have the console
			view open (Window -> Show View -> Console) you should see the
			familiar output of the GAE and be able to open the application in
			your browser as before.
