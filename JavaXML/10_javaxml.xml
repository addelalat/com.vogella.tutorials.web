	<title>Java XML overview</title>
	<para>
		The Java programming language contains several methods for
		processing and writing XML.
	</para>
	<para>Older Java versions supported only the DOM API (Document Object
		Model) and the SAX (Simple API for XML) API.
	</para>
	<para>In DOM you
		access the XML
		document over an object tree. DOM can be
		used to read
		and write XML
		files.
	</para>
	<para>SAX (Simple API for XML)
		is a Java API for
		sequential reading of
		XML files. SAX can only read XML
		documents. SAX provides an
		event driven
		XML Processing following the
		Push-Parsing Model, e.g., you register
		listeners in the
		form of Handlers to the
		Parser and these are
		notified
		through call-back
		methods.
	</para>
	<para>Both DOM and
		Sax are older APIs
		and I recommend not using them anymore.
	</para>
	<para> Stax (Streaming API for XML) is an API for
		reading and writing
		XML Documents. It was introduced in Java 6.0 and
		is considered better
		than SAX
		and DOM.
	</para>
	<para>
		Java Architecture for XML Binding (
		<ulink url="http://www.vogella.com/tutorials/JAXB/article.html">JAXB</ulink>
		) is a Java standard that
		defines how Java objects are
		converted to
		XML
		and vice versa (specified using a
		standard set of mappings).
		JAXB
		defines a
		programmer API for reading and
		writing Java objects to
		/ from
		XML
		documents and a service provider
		which allows
		the selection of the
		JAXB
		implementation. JAXB applies
		a lot of defaults
		thus making reading
		and
		writing
		of XML via Java very easy.
	</para>
