== Debugging

The easiest way to "debug" JavaScript is to use the `alert()` method which allows to give the user some feedback. 
This is the equivalent to `println` in other programming languages. 
For example the following program shows a popup with the currently value to the user.

[source, javascript]
----
include::res/alert/alert.html[]
----

You can also open the webpage in a Browser like Chrome and debug it there.
