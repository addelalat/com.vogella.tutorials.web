== JavaScript Frontend Example

In this example, we'll build an *Angular.JS* single page application with _routing_ and _controllers_.
The styling will be done with *Bootstrap* and *FontAwesome*.
At the end, we'll use a *Node.js* _script_ to launch an *Express* _server_ and serve the application on _localhost_.

=== Install frontend components with Bower

Create a `bower.json` file, using the shortcut: kbd:[Ctrl] + kbd:[N] > _"Bower init"_.
Add the dependencies we'll use in the project: *angular*, *angular-route*, *bootstrap* and *font-awesome*.

The bower file should look like the snippet below.

[source, JSON]
----
include::res/jsdt.demo01/bower.json[]
----

JSDT integrates the Bower command in Eclipse, so you can launch it via context menu.

To download and install all the frontend components,
right-click on the `bower.json` file, and select *Run As.. > Bower Install*.

So doing, all the needed components will be downloaded under the default folder: *bower_components*.

=== Test frontend libraries

We test the imported libraries with a simple HTML using the most important javascript and css.

* In the <html> tag, use the `ng-app` directive
* In <head>, reference js and css libs from bower_components
* In <body>, test Bootstrap styling and Angular instructions.

[source, HTML]
----
include::res/jsdt.demo01/index_01.html[]
----

You can test visually that Boostrap is loaded and Angular is working.
The working web application, should look like the image below.

image::jsdt.demo01-hello-world-01.png[]

In this case you can verify that Boostrap is providing styles to the page,
and putting a link::res/jsdt.demo01/html_128.png[square image] in a circle;
while Angular can evaluate expressions like `{{'Hello,'+' world!'}}`.

Below you can see a screenshot of what the page would look like in case Angular and Bootstrap are not loaded.

image::jsdt.demo01-hello-world-01b-no-libs.png[]


=== Angular Application

Create a javascript file named `application.js`, which will contain the code for the Angular application, and paste the code below.

[source, javascript]
----
include::res/jsdt.demo01/application_02.js[]
----

The first line creates an Angular application named *jsdtApp*, and declare it uses *ngRoute* as imported module.

The second statement, defines a controller named *mainController*.
When the controller is created, assigns a value to `$scope.message`,
a scope variable that we will use later, to display a message.

==== Use Angular Application in HTML

Now we edit the HTML file use the Angular application.

* In <html>, set the application name `ng-app="jsdtApp"`, as we defined in the module.
* In <head>, include the angular application: *application.js*
* In <body>, add the controller directive: `ng-controller="mainController"`
* In <div id="main">, print the message from the controller: `$scope.message` .

The HTML below represents a full working solution

[source, HTML]
----
include::res/jsdt.demo01/index_02.html[]
----

Test visually the angular controller is working by observing the {{message}} is present.

image::jsdt.demo01-hello-world-02.png[]

=== Angular Routing

Routing means loading dynamically multiple HTML views inside a SPA (Single Page Application).

As an example, we'll use clickable links on the navigation bar, to change the main content.

WARNING: Angular routing is not intended to work on local files. You should serve pages using a web server to avoid *Cross origin request* problems.

==== Multiple HTML Views

We start creating three views to display the contents: *about*, *contact*, and *home*.

[source, HTML]
----
include::res/jsdt.demo01/pages/home.html[]
----

[source, HTML]
----
include::res/jsdt.demo01/pages/about.html[]
----

[source, HTML]
----
include::res/jsdt.demo01/pages/contact.html[]
----

Note that the views are different each other, but all are using a  `{{message}}` object.
Also note the views are using css classes `bg-light`, `bg-dark` and `bg-orange`, to be defined later.

==== Configure Routing and multiple Controllers

As we already included the `angular-route.js` script in the HTML,
we can add the dependency to the `ngRoute` module in the Angular.js application.

Then, we edit the javascript file, using the the `$routeProvider`,
to configure three routes, one for each content page we created.

For each route we declare its *path*;
we define the *templateUrl* to find the HTML view template;
and we assign a *controller* to manage the view lifecycle.

Then, we add three controllers to the app, one for each page.
So doing we store page specific messages in the angular `$scope`.

Note: controllers contains business logic for a view.
You can learn more in the https://docs.angularjs.org/guide/controller[official documentation]

Based on the above premises, we edit the javascript file,
so that it looks like the snippet you can see below.

[source, javascript]
----
include::res/jsdt.demo01/application_03.js[lines=4..43]
----

==== Enable Routing in HTML

To enable routing we need to edit the main HTML file as follows:

* Add navigation links to activate routing
* Add the `ng-view` tag, to mark the area to be replaced by views

Below you can see the updated HTML inside the `<body>` element.

[source, HTML]
----
include::res/jsdt.demo01/index_03.html[lines=22..43]
----

==== Add style

To complete the page, add some inline style,
to give different colors at the content pages,
and to animate the user selection on navigation bar.

[source, HTML]
----
<head>
  ...
include::res/jsdt.demo01/index_03.html[lines=15..21]
----


==== Test Routing avoiding issues

As anticipated, Angular Routing is not supposed to work on local files.
Therefore, you can see empty areas, when loading an HTML file from the local filesystem.

At the time I'm writing, Firefox is able to render the routing example as we expect.

image::jsdt.demo01-routing-01-firefox.png[]

But, Chrome doesn't work as Firefox, as its security model doesn't allow serving local files when routing.
In this case, you can detect the error inspecting the page and looking at the console.

image::jsdt.demo.01-hello-frontend-03-no-routing.png[]

The real point of this section, is understanding that your frontend is not a simple local webpage.
Instead, it is an application that should live in a webserver.

To fix this, we'll use Node.js to launch a lightweight server and publish our SPA.
So doing, you'll access the frontend at a web address like http://localhost:3222

=== Node.js server on Localhost

In this section, we'll see how to use Node.js to launch a local server to display our frontend.

Create a *package.json* file with the content you see in the snippet below.

[source, JSON]
----
include::res/jsdt.demo01/package.json[]
----

Note that we are importing two existing node modules:

* *express*, providing a lightweight local server
* *open*, providing a command to launch the default browser.

Then, use the JSDT integrations to install the libraries.
Right-click on the `package.json` and select *Run As.. > NPM Install*.

image::run-as-npm-install-2.png[]

This will install the needed dependencies under the `node_modules` folder.

Then, create a javascript file called *launch-server.js* with the content below.

[source, javascript]
----
include::res/jsdt.demo01/launch-server.js[]
----

As you can see, the code loads the modules, starts the local server, and opens the inex.html.
Please, not this server is configured to support URL-rewrite, hence you can reload pages and re-use URLs like in common rest applications.

Now, run the Node.js script to see the frontend application running on server.
R-click 'launch-static-server.js' and select *Run As .. > Node.js Application*. This will launch node passing your script as parameter

image::run-as-nodejs-application-2.png[]

Now that the application is running on a local webserver, we can test it works as expected.
Below you can see screenshots with the final result.

=== Tips for a Professional Single Page Application

To have a more professional single-page applications, we should remove hashtags from webaddresses.

To do so, first you should use the `$locationProvide.html5Mode`, as shown below.

[source, javascript]
----
include::res/jsdt.demo01/application_04.js[lines=5..6]
  // ..
include::res/jsdt.demo01/application_04.js[lines=20..22]
----

Then we should edit the HTML, by removing hashtags in redirect URLs

[source, HTML]
----
include::res/jsdt.demo01/index_04.html[lines=31..35]
----

Finally you can see that the URLs in your web applications are now looking more professional.
