When done, click _Next_ and finalize the installation.

When the installation is complete, the development IDE is launched automatically.

At the first startup, you'll have to wait for the completion of the  startup tasks.
Startup tasks include getting source from Git, updating Mylyn tasks,
and also requesting additional authentication if needed.

When the startup tasks are done, click away the welcome window, and enter the IDE.
Verify the source code is downloaded and available in different project sets.

In the IDE, you can also see a list of Mylyn tasks for _JSDT Bugs_, and _Open reviews_.

==== Launch JSDT

In this section we'll run JSDT from source code using an existing launch configuration.
Select from menu: _Run > Run Configuration.._ , and select the JSDT Launch Configuration.

This launch configuration contains all the plug-ins needed to run JSDT,
and also defines the VM arguments needed to hook Nashorn.

To verify the run configuration works, click *Run*, to launch Eclipse IDE with JSDT.
Then create a JavaScript project and create a new npm init file inside the project.

Now you are able to run JSDT from the source code, and you can easily contribute to the project.
