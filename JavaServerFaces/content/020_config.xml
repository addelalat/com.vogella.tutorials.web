=== Overview
		
			JSF is based on the following configuration files:
			
				<listitem>web.xml - General web application configuration file
				</listitem>
				<listitem>
					faces-config.xml - Contains the configuration
						of the JSF
						application.
				</listitem>
			</itemizedlist>
		


[[jsfconfig_webxml">
=== web.xml
		
			JSF requires the central
			configuration list `web.xml` in the
			directory WEB-INF of the
			application. This is similar to other
			web-applications which are based on
			servlets.
		
		
			You must specify in `web.xml` that a
			"FacesServlet" is
			responsible for handling JSF applications.
			"FacesServlet" is the
			central controller for the JSF
			application.

			"FacesServlet" receives all
			requests for the JSF
			application and
			initializes the JSF
			components
			before the JSP is displayed. 
		

[[jsfconfig_facesconfigxml">
=== faces-config.xml
		
			"faces-config.xml" allows to configure the application, managed
			beans, convertors, validators, and navigation.
