== JSON Introduction

JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is an independent data exchange format designed for representing simple data structures. 
JSON is limited to text and numeric values. 
Binary values are not supported.

JSON was originally derived as a subset of the JavaScript Specification (ECME-Script) and it is therefore directly supported in JavaScript.

Data structures in JSON are based on key / value pairs.
The key is a string, the value can be a numerical value, a boolean value (true or false) or an object.

WARNING: While undefined by the standard you should avoid using duplicate key names. 
Most JSON frameworks will override duplicate keys with the last value.
