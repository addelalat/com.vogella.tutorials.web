	<para> JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is an independent data
		exchange
		format designed for representing simple data structures. JSON
		is limited to text and numeric values. Binary
		values are
		not supported.
	</para>
	<para>
		JSON was originally derived as a subset of the JavaScript
		Specification (ECME-Script)
		and it is therefore directly supported in
		JavaScript.
	</para>
	<para>
		Data structures in JSON are based on key / value pairs.
		The
		key is
		a
		string, the
		value can be a numerical value, a boolean value
		(true or
		false) or an
		object.
	</para>
	<warning>
		<para>While undefined by the standard you should avoid using duplicate
			key names. Most JSON frameworks will override duplicate keys with the
			last value.</para>
