== Example
[[wsexample_server">
=== Create the server Java project
		Create a Java project
			"de.vogella.webservice.java6.first.provider". Create a package with
			the same name and then the following class.
		
[source,text]
----
include::res/WiseQuoteServer.java[]
----
		
		
			If you start your main program the service should be up and running.
			<tip>Try to access http://localhost:9191/wisequotes?wsdl via a
				browser. You should see the WSDL of your server.
		

[[wsexample_clientcode">
		 Create now the client code. Using the console switch to an
			empty directory and call the wsimport command line tool which is part
			of the JDK.
		
			<tip> the JDK/bin directory needs to be in your path to be able to
				call wsimport.

		This call will create an interface with the webservice
			methods and factory to use the webservice.

[[wsexample_client">
=== Using the Webservice
		 Create a new Java project
			"de.vogella.webservice.java6.first.consumer" create a package with
			the same name, copy the created java classes to your new project /
			package and adjust the path name.
		 Create a new Java class TestWS.java with the following coding.
			The code demonstrates how to get the connection directly and how to
			get the connection with specifying the URL.
		
			<tip> Specifying the URL is useful in case you what to use a
				TCP-monitor to trace the TCP data. In this case you would direct the
				client to the TCP monitor which would re-direct the TCP data to the
				server and vice versa.
