[[modules">
== Using external jars / Java projects in GWT
[[modules_overview">
=== Overview
		The standard approach in Java is to have separated projects for
			separate purposes. For example the domain model of the application is
			usually defined in its own project.
			One way of making these classes
			available to GWT is to copy
			them into the
			package "client" in your GWT
			project. This is bad
			practice as it leads
			to code duplication (which is
			inherently evil).
			This chapter describes how you can make these
			projects
			available to the
			GWT compiler as modules.
		 GWT need to have access to the source files to compile them
			into Javascript code. If you add the project or the jar file to your
			GWT classpath then the Java compiler will not complain if you use the
			classes from the included project / jar but the GWT compiler will not
			be able to compile them.
		
			To make the Java files available to the GWT compiler you need to
			<itemizedlist>
				<listitem>
					Create a gwt.xml file in the Java project / jar file
						which you
						want to use - This will instruct the GWT compiler to use
						the listed
						classes.
				</listitem>
				<listitem>
					Use the included library via the inherit definition
				</listitem>
				<listitem>
					If you are using a jar file you also need to include the
						source files in the jar
				</listitem>
			</itemizedlist>
		

[[modules_createmodule">
=== Create the module project
		 Create a Java project "de.vogella.gwt.module.model" and package
			"de.vogella.gwt.module.model". Create the following class.
		
			<programlisting>
				<xi:include xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude"
					parse="text" href="../examples/module/Person.java[]
----
		
		 Create in package "de.vogella.gwt.module" the file
			"model.gwt.xml" with the following content.
			This will be the module definition for GWT. 
		
		
			<programlisting>
				<xi:include xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude"
					parse="text" href="../examples/module/model.gwt.xml[]
----
		

[[modules_use">
=== Use the module in another project

		We want to use this model in a GWT project. Create therefore a
			new GWT project "de.vogella.gwt.module.application" similar to the
			first example of this article with the following entry point.
		
			<programlisting>
				<xi:include xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude"
					parse="text" href="../examples/module/ModulTest.java[]
----
		
		 To make the module project available for the Java compiler,
			right-click your project, select properties -> Java Build Path
			and add
			a dependency to the project "de.vogella.gwt.module.model".

		 Make the Java class of your new module available to the GWT
			compiler by using "inherits" in your file
			"De_vogella_gwt_module_application.gwt.xml".
		
			<programlisting>
				<xi:include xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude"
					parse="text"
					href="../examples/module/De_vogella_gwt_module_application.gwt.xml[]
----
		
		
			<tip> If you make a typo here you will get an error message: [ERROR] Unable
				to find 'de/vogella/gwt/module/model2.gwt.xml' on your classpath;
				could be a typo, or maybe you forgot to include a classpath entry
				for source?
		
		 If everything was setup correctly you can run your application.
