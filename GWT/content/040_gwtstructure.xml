		An GWT application consists of the following parts
		
			<listitem>
				Module descriptor: XML file which specifies mainly the
					entry
					point of the application. It has the name of your module plus
					.gwt.xml
			</listitem>
			<listitem>
				war: Under the folder "war" you find the HTML page which
					contains the GWT application. Additional public resources, e.g.
					other HTML pages, images or css files should be stored here. Here
					you find also the standard WEB-INF folder.
			</listitem>
			<listitem>
				Source code: under your default package your find a
					package
					"client" All Java code which is compiled for the client
					(Webbrowser) must be stored under client. For the service you would
					use the package "server".
			</listitem>
		</itemizedlist>

=== Module Descriptor
		 The main purpose of the Module descriptor in *.gwt.xml file is
			to define your entry-point. It also defines standard GWT css
			styles which you are using.
