		<title>Google Web Toolkit</title>
		<para> The Google Web Toolkit (GWT) is a toolkit to develop Ajax web
			application with Java. The programmer writes Java code and this code is
			translated into
			HTML and Javascript via the GWT compiler. 
			</para>

		<para>
			
			The
			compiler creates browser
			specific HTML and JavaScript to
			support
			all the
			major browsers
			correctly. GWT
			supports a standard
			set of UI widgets, has build in
			support for the browser back button
			and a JUnit based
			test framework.
		</para>

		<para>
			GWT provides two modes
			<itemizedlist>
				<listitem>
					<para>Development Mode: allows to debug the Java code of your
						application directly via the standard Java debugger.
					</para>
				</listitem>
				<listitem><para>Web mode: the application is translated into HTML and
						Javascript
						code and can be deployed to a web server.
					</para>

		<title>Modules, Entry Points and HTML pages</title>
		<para>
			GWT applications are described as
			modules. A module
			"modulename" is
			described by a configuration file
			"modulename.gwt.xml". Each module
			can define one or more
			<emphasis> Entry point</emphasis>
			classes.
			An entry point is the starting point for a GWT
			application,
			similar to the main method in a standard Java program. 
			A Java class which is an entry point must implement the
			interface
			"com.google.gwt.core.client.EntryPoint" which defines the
			method
			onModuleLoad().
		</para>
		<para>The module is connected to a HTML page, which is called "host
			page". The code for a GWT web
			application executes within
			this HTML
			document.
		</para>
		<para>
			The HTML page can
			define "div" containers to which
			the GWT
			application
			can
			assign UI
			components or the GWT UI
			components are simply assigned to the 
			body tag of the HTML page.
		</para>

	<section id="overview_css">
		<title>Using CSS</title>
		<para> The look and feel of a GWT application can be customized via
			CSS files. Each widget in GWT can be given a HTML "div" container and can therefore be individually styled by CSS. 
			You use the Java
			method setStyle(String s) for this.
