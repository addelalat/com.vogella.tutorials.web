== Tutorial: Create your C2DM enabled application
[[example_project">
=== Project and Layout
		
			Create the Android project
			"de.vogella.android.c2dm.simpleclient" with
			the
			activity
			"C2DMClientActivity". Create the following layout
			`main.xml`
			.
		

		
			<programlisting>
				<xi:include xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude"
					parse="text" href="./examples/first/main.xml[]
----
		
		 Also create the layout "activity_result.xml" which we will use
			in our result activities.
		
		
			<programlisting>
				<xi:include xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude"
					parse="text" href="./examples/first/activity_result.xml[]
----
		


[[example_manifest">
=== Create receivers and activities

		 Create the following class "C2DMReceiverReceiver" and
			"C2DMMessageReceiver" which we will later
			registers as receivers for
			the registration intent and the message intent.
		


		
			<programlisting>
				<xi:include xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude"
					parse="text" href="./examples/first/C2DMRegistrationReceiver.java[]
----
		

		
			<programlisting>
				<xi:include xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude"
					parse="text" href="./examples/first/C2DMMessageReceiver.java[]
----
		
		 Also create the following two Activities which we will use to
			see the results.
		


		
			<programlisting>
				<xi:include xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude"
					parse="text" href="./examples/first/RegistrationResultActivity.java[]
----
		

		
			<programlisting>
				<xi:include xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude"
					parse="text" href="./examples/first/MessageReceivedActivity.java[]
----
		

		
			Create the following
			`AndroidManifest.xml`
			file. That will register
			the Intent Receivers, Activities and requests
			the required
			permissions.
		

		
			<programlisting>
				<xi:include xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude"
					parse="text" href="./examples/first/AndroidManifest.xml[]
----
		
		 Change your "C2DMClientActivity" class to the following.
		
		
			<programlisting>
				<xi:include xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude"
					parse="text" href="./examples/first/C2DMClientActivity.java[]
----
		
		 The methods in the activity are connected to the buttons via
			the onclick property of the buttons. The first button
			triggers a
			request for a registration ID and the second button shows the
			saved
			registration key. Both also write the registration id also to the
			Logcat View.
		
		
			Copy the registration Id from the Logcat View so that you can
			later use it in your server implementation.
		

[[example_register">
=== Register your application

		Run your application, maintain your registered user and press
			the button. Check LogCat for the registration ID.
		
		
			If you see the following message:
		
		
[source,java]
----
include::res/snippets/message.txt[]
----
		



		
			make
			sure you are using a Google device and that you have a
			Google
			user
			registered on the device.
