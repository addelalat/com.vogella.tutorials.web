== Cloud to device messaging

[[c2dm_overview]]
=== Polling vs. Push

Most mobile apps require data from the Internet.
One
approach for
updating its data is that the
apps
periodically
polls a server for new
data (Polling). If
no new data is available this approach uses
unnecessary
network
bandwidth and consumes the battery of the mobile phone.

An alternative approach is that
the server contacts the mobile
app once new data is available (Push). If the data does not
change
constantly, Push is the preferred solution.

[[c2dm_messaging]]
=== Cloud service

Via the Google Play services you can push notifications to your
application. To do this you must enable
_Google Cloud Messaging for Android_
in the
https://console.developers.google.com/project[Google API Console].

In a C2DM you have three involved parties. The application
server which
wants to push messages to the Android device,
Googles C2DM
servers
and the Android app. 
The program on the application server can
be written in
any programming language, e.g. Java, PHP, Python, etc.

When the application server needs to push a message to
the Android
application, it
sends the message via an HTTP POST to
Googleâ€™s C2DM servers.

The C2DM servers route the message to the device. 
If the device
is not online, the message will be delivered once the device
is available. 
Once the message is received, an Broadcast Intent is created. 
The mobile app has registered an Intent Receiver for this Broadcast. 
The app is started
and processes the
message via the
defined
Intent Receiver.

C2DM messages are limited in
size to 1024 bytes and are intended
to inform the device about new
data not to transfer it.
The typical
workflow is that Googles C2DM servers notify
the
Android
app
that new
data is available. Afterwards the
Android
app
fetches the data
from a
different server.

Android devices maintain an connection to the Android Play server. 
C2DM uses this existing connections to the Google servers.
This connection
is
highly optimize to minimize bandwidth and battery
consumption.

C2DM is currently still in beta and you need to apply to use it.
C2DM applies a limit of approximately 200 000 messages per
sender per
day and is currently free of charge.

[[_c2dm_requirements]]
=== Requirements

C2MD is available as of Android 2.2 and requires that
Android
Play application is installed on the device.

To use C2DM on the Android simulator you also need to use a
Google device with API 8 or higher and to register with a Google
account on the emulator via the Settings.

[[c2dm_permissions]]
=== Permissions

To use C2DM in your application to have to register for the following
permissions

* com.google.android.c2dm.permission.RECEIVE  
* android.permission.INTERNET     

Your application
should also declare the permission
"applicationPackage +
".permission.C2D_MESSAGE" with the
"android:protectionLevel" of
"signature" so that other applications
cannot register
and receive
message for the application.
android:protectionLevel="signature".
ensures that applications with
request a permission must be signed
with same certificate as the
application that declared the
permission.

[[c2dm_receiver]]
=== Intent Receiver

Your application must register an intent receiver for
the two
intents:

* com.google.android.c2dm.intent.REGISTRATION      
* com.google.android.c2dm.intent.RECEIVE   

The receiver for "com.google.android.c2dm.intent.RECEIVE" will
be called once a new message is received, while the receiver for
"com.google.android.c2dm.intent.REGISTRATION" will be called once the
registration code for the app is received.
