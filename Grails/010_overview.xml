		<title>What is Grails?</title>
		<para>
			<wordasword>Grails</wordasword>
			is a web framework based on
			Groovy
			and Java which can be
			deployed into
			existing Java web servers, e.g., Tomcat
			or
			Jetty.
		</para>

		<para>
			Grails allows to quickly create web applications; its
			scaffolding
			capabilities let you create a new
			project within few
			minutes. Grails
			is
			based on the
			<wordasword>convention over configuration</wordasword>
			idea
			which allows
			the application to auto-wire
			itself based on naming
			schemes (instead
			of
			using
			configuration files, e.g, XML files).
		</para>
		<para>
			Grails uses JavaEE as the architectural basis and Spring for
			structuring the application via dependency injection.
		</para>
		<para>
			The Grails framework allows instance development without
			requiring any configuration.
			Just download Grails and you are ready to
			start. Grails accomplish this
			by automatically providing the Tomcat
			web container
			and the HSQLDB database during development. If you
			deploy
			you Grails application later, you can use another
			web container
			or
			database.
		</para>


		<para>
			Grails is plug-in based and currently uses its own build system
			(Gant) but plans to migrated to Gradle. The Grails homepage provides
			several pre-defined plugins
			which extend the Grails framework.
		</para>
		<para>
			During the start of a new development with Grails you mainly
			use
			the command line to generated new user interfaces.

		<title>Object relationship mapping (ORM) with GORM</title>

		<para>
			Grails uses
			<wordasword>GORM</wordasword>
			(Grails Object Relational Mapping) for the
			persistence of the domain
			model. GORM is based on
			Hibernate. You can
			test with the
			HSQLDB and run
			in production
			against
			another database
			simply by
			changing the
			configuration file
			(
			<filename>DataSource.groovy</filename>
			).
