== Exercise: Extend Grails web application

[[guestbookapplication_target]]
=== Target

In this exercise you finish the  guestbook application you started in <<firstgrails>>.

[[guestbookapplication_stopserver]]
=== Stop the server

If you Grails application from
<<firstgrails>>
is still running, stop the server via
kbd:[Ctrl+C].
We need the command line to
create more elements.

[[guestbookapplication_model]]
=== Create the domain model

Our application does not do anything at the moment. Lets create the
a
domain
model.
For your feedback system we would like to have:

* Class Feedback: The feedback itself
* Class User: The person who gives feedback
* Class Comment: A remark to the feedback

Grails can create templates with empty classes and prepared unit
tests for your domain model. Create the domain model scaffolds via
the
following
commands:

[source,bourne]
----
include::res/firstgrails/create-domain-class.txt[]
----

This creates Groovy classes for the specified domain model in the directory `.\grails-app/domain`. 
In the
directory
`.\test\unit`
you
find empty files for your unit tests.

Use a text editor to change the classes to the following:

[source,java]
----
include::res/firstgrails/Feedback.java[]
----

[source,java]
----
include::res/firstgrails/User.java[]
----

[source,java]
----
include::res/firstgrails/Comment.java[]
----

Grails allows to define
constraints for the domain model via a
static
method. Some of these
constraints, e.g.,
`nullable`
are reflected
in the database, others are
only used to validate this
value via the
user interface, e.g., the URL
constraint.

TIP: All model classes come with have a version and id property of type `Long` and a `toString()` method by default.
These methods will be dynamically injected if the model has no implementation of it's own.
`dataCreated` and `lastUpdated` are also known by Grails and will be filled automatically.

[TIP]
====
Changes in the domain model may require a restart of the Grails server and running the following command:

[source,bourne]
----
include::res/firstgrails/grailsclean.txt[]
----

[[guestbookapplication_controllerview]]
=== Dynamic Scaffolding

Grails supports dynamic and static scaffolding for the user
interface. If you use dynamic scaffolding, then a user interface for
the
domain class is dynamically generated by the Grails runtime. This
user
interface allows the operations Create, Read, Update and Delete
(CRUD).

To use dynamic scaffolding, create controllers for your domain
class via the following commands:

[source,bourne]
----
include::res/firstscripts/generate-controller.txt[]
----

This creates controller classes in the directory `/grails-app/controllers`.

Activate the dynamic scaffolding in each controller by
replacing the
line which starts with
`def index`
with
`def scaffold = NameOfTheDomainClass`.
For example, for the
`FeedbackController`.

[source,java]
----
include::res/firstgrails/FeedbackController.java[]
----

Do this also for
`UserController`
and
`CommentController`.

[[guestbookapplication_testing]]
=== Testing the generated application

Run the application again via:

[source,bourne]
----
include::res/firstgrails/grailsrun.txt[]
----

Browse to

....
http://localhost:8080/com.vogella.grails.guestbook
....

You should have a full CRUD (create, retrieve, update, delete)
application available. To start the app, click on
_UserController_
and create a user.

image::firstgrails40.png[pdfwidth=40%]

Afterwards use the _FeedbackController_ to create a comment.

Click on _New Feedback_ and enter a feedback.
