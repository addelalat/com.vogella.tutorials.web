== Exercise: Create Grails web application

[[firstgrails_target]]
=== Target

We want to develop a guestbook application, in this exercise see
start with the intial template.

[[firstgrails_create]]
=== Create your application

Let's create the application with the name
`com.vogella.grails.guestbook`. 
#The name of the application is used for the URL on which
the
application will later run and the WAR file which will be later
created.

Create a new directory that will
contain your Grails
application.
Open a
command shell, switch to this
new
directory and
type in the
following
command.

[source,bourne]
----
include::res/firstgrails/create-app.txt[]
----

After a little while the command line tells you that the
application was
generated.

This command creates the directory structure and the base
configuration of your new web application.

This created already a full web application.

[[firstgrails_run]]
=== Run your application

The created application can already run. In the shell switch
into your
directory
`com.vogella.grails.guestbook`.
You can then start
your
application with the following
command.

[source,bourne]
----
include::res/firstgrails/grailsrun.txt[]
----

This should start
the Grails internal web container and you
should
receive the message
"Server running. Browse to
http://localhost:8080/com.vogella.grails.guestbook".
Open a browser
and
open the URL

http://localhost:8080/com.vogella.grails.guestbook
