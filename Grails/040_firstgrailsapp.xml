=== Target
		We want to develop a guestbook application, in this exercise see
			start with the intial template.
		


	<section id="firstgrails_create">
=== Create your application
		
			Let's create the application with the name
			<code>com.vogella.grails.guestbook</code>
			. The name of the application is used for the URL on which
			the
			application will later run and the WAR file which will be later
			created.
		
		
			Create a new directory that will
			contain your Grails
			application.
			Open a
			command shell, switch to this
			new
			directory and
			type in the
			following
			command.
		
		
			<programlisting language="bourne">
				<xi:include xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude"
					parse="text" href="./examples/firstgrails/create-app.txt[]
----
		
		
			After a little while the command line tells you that the
			application was
			generated.
		
		
			This command creates the directory structure and the base
			configuration of your new web application.

			This created already a full web application.
		


	<section id="firstgrails_run">
=== Run your application
		
			The created application can already run. In the shell switch
			into your
			directory
			<filename class="directory">com.vogella.grails.guestbook`
			.
			You can then start
			your
			application with the following
			command.
		
		
			<programlisting language="Bourne">
				<xi:include xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude"
					parse="text" href="./examples/firstgrails/grailsrun.txt[]
----
		
		
			This should start
			the Grails internal web container and you
			should
			receive the message
			"Server running. Browse to
			http://localhost:8080/com.vogella.grails.guestbook".
			Open a browser
			and
			open the URL
		
		
http://localhost:8080/com.vogella.grails.guestbook">
				http://localhost:8080/com.vogella.grails.guestbook
