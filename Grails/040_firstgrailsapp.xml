		We want to develop a guestbook application, in this exercise see
			start with the intial template.
		


[[firstgrails_create">
=== Create your application
		
			Let's create the application with the name
			<code>com.vogella.grails.guestbook</code>
			. The name of the application is used for the URL on which
			the
			application will later run and the WAR file which will be later
			created.
		
		
			Create a new directory that will
			contain your Grails
			application.
			Open a
			command shell, switch to this
			new
			directory and
			type in the
			following
			command.

			After a little while the command line tells you that the
			application was
			generated.
		
		
			This command creates the directory structure and the base
			configuration of your new web application.

			The created application can already run. In the shell switch
			into your
			directory
			<filename class="directory">com.vogella.grails.guestbook`

			command.

			receive the message
			"Server running. Browse to

			Open a browser
			and
