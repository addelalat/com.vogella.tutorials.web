== Exercise: Bootstrap and persists data
[[bootstrapandpersistsdata_target">
=== Target
		
			In this exercise you create example data and store the data between
			application restarts. This exercise builds on
			<xref linkend="guestbookapplication" />
			.
		


[[firstgrails_scaffolding">
=== Bootstrapping example data
		
			Grails allows to simulate example data (this is called
			bootstrapping).
			To create example data, you can use the class
			`BootStrap.groovy`
			from
			the
			directory
			<filename class="directory">./grails-app/conf`
			with some data.
			This class is
			automatically executed whenever the
			server is started
			and can be used
			to create some example data for
			testing.
		

		Change the code to the following.

		
[source,java]
----
include::res/firstgrails/Bootstrap.java[]
----
		
		
			The grails server should pickup the change automatically. Wait
			a
			while (or re-start the server to be sure) and check if you get an
			error message.
		


[[firstgrailsapp_store">
=== Store the data
		
			By default, the data maintained in the web application is not
			stored. If your entries should be saved to the database after server
			shutdown, use the following command to start it.
		
		
			<programlisting language="Bourne">
				<xi:include xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude"
					parse="text" href="./examples/firstgrails/prod-run-app.txt[]
----
		
		
			<tip>
				Remove the bootstrapped entries as you will otherwise get errors
				as the system tries to create the same entries again.
			
		


[[firstgrails_controllerview_scaffolding">
=== Static scaffolding
		
			To switch from dynamic scaffolding to static scaffolding, you
			need to have views. Grails can generate them for you.
		
		
			Type in the following to create a scaffold for the controller
			and the view.
		
		
			<programlisting language="Bourne">
				<xi:include xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude"
					parse="text" href="./examples/firstscripts/generate-views.txt[]
----
		
		
			<tip>
				If you receive the error "Error starting Sun's native2ascii",
				then
				make sure that your environment variable
				<property>JAVA_HOME</property>
				points to
				the JDK and not JRE. The JDK is required for this step.
			
		
		
			Remove
			<code>def scaffold = true</code>
			in your controller to use your
			generated views.
		
		
			This creates the GSP (Groovy Server pages) for your actions in
			the
			directroy
			<filename class="directory">grails-app\views`
			.
			GSP are standard HTML code with
			Groovy mixed in.
			Have a look at the
			coding. The
			controller
			defines
			several actions
			(list,
			show, delete, edit).
			For all
			these
			actions
			corresponding views
			have been
			created under
			<filename class="directory">grails-app/views`
			.
