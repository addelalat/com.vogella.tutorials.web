== Exercise - Spring Data Rest

=== Target

This exercise should show how to use Spring Data Rest with an H2 database.

=== Create a Spring Data Rest Project

Create a spring starter project, via the menu:New[Spring Starter] menu entry.

Use the following input for the wizard:

Now press btn:[Next] and choose _Lombok_,  _JPA_, _H2_, _Thymeleaf_, _Rest Repositories_ and _HATEOAS_.

Then press btn:[Finish] in order to create a Spring Data Rest project.

=== Reusing Todo and TodoRepository 

The `Todo` and `TodoRepository` can be reused from the previous <<exercise-spring-data-jpa>>.

The `TodoRepository` needs to have the `@RepositoryRestResource` annotation.

[source, java]
----
include::res/rest/TodoRepositoryRest.java[]
----

The `@RepositoryRestResource` annotation will create restful endpoints for 

....
http://localhost:8080/todoes
....

=== Validate

Add some todos to the repo and query them via rest endpoint.

Again a `CommandLineRunner` can be used for this.

But this time the data won't be received from the `TodoRepository` directly, but by using the Spring `RestTemplate`.

[source, java]
----
include::res/rest/Application.java[]
----

Running the application should result in the following output.

[source, shell]
----
Todo [id=1, summary=Test, description=null]
Todo [id=2, summary=Detailed test, description=Detailed description]
----

=== Configure the rest endpoint path

Spring is able to guess a name for the rest endpoint, as it has been done with the `/todoes` endpoint.

But in some situations a different endpoint is desired, e.g., _todos_ or _tasks_ rather then _todoes_.

Therefore the `@RepositoryRestResource` annotation can have additional parameters.

[source, java]
----
include::res/rest/TodoRepositoryRestPath.java[]
----

And then also the `Application` class has to be slightly modified, so that the URLs are 

....
http://localhost:8080/tasks/1 and http://localhost:8080/tasks/2 
....

now.

[source, java]
----
include::res/rest/ApplicationPath.java[]
----

=== Adding new Todos

The provided rest API can also handle post or put requests.

The following snippet can be added at the end of the `CommandLineRunner` from  the previous section.

[source, java]
----
include::res/rest/ApplicationPost.java[]
----

The output of this snippet should look like this:

[source, plain]
----
<201 Created,Todo [id=0, summary=New Todo, description=Todo added by rest API],{Server=[Apache-Coyote/1.1], Location=[http://localhost:8080/tasks/3], Content-Type=[application/json;charset=UTF-8], Transfer-Encoding=[chunked], Date=[Tue, 31 May 2016 16:48:47 GMT]}>
----

[TIP] 
====
The _Location_ in the output tells where to find the newly added `Todo`. 
This can be found by either using the `RestTemplate` again or by using curl: 

....
curl http://localhost:8080/tasks/3
....
