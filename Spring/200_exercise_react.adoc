== Exercise - Creating a UI frontend with react

=== Target

In this exercise a UI frontend with react is created.

=== Using rest.js react to show a list of Todos

In order to make use of react these packages are required:

* const React = require('react');
* const ReactDOM = require('react-dom');

With the `React.Component` class web components can be defined, which are rendered.

[source, javascript]
----
include::res/js/app-react-basic.js[]
----

When the _app.js_ script has been changed, Webpack needs to be run again so that a new _bundle.js_ file is generated.

=== Validate

Run the Spring application and see the table of Todos.
