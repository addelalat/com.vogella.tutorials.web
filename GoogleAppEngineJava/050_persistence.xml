== Persistence with JPA
		
			GAE/J supports
http://www.vogella.com/tutorials/JavaPersistenceAPI/article.html[JPA] (Java Persistence API)
			1.0 for persisting data. As all data on the GAE/J are
			stored in
			Bigtable
			some features of JPA are not supported. See
http://code.google.com/intl/de-DE/appengine/docs/java/datastore/usingjpa.html[JPA on GAE/J]
			for details.
			Alternatively to JPA you can also use JDO or the low-level API of the App Engine. The
			datastorage facility is described in
http://code.google.com/appengine/docs/java/datastore/overview.html[Datastore Java API Overview]
			.
