== Cron jobs
	 You can define cron jobs in your application. Via a cron job on
		th AppEngine you
		can access a URL according to a time pattern which is
		defined similar to the cron jobs on Unix. You define your cron jobs in
		a file "cron.xml" in the `WEB-INF`
		folder of you application.

				parse="text" href="./examples/cron/cron.xml[]
----
	

	 This cron job will call the local website /count every minute.
	

	 You can check you cron jobs in the admin console.

		<tip>Please note that you should avoid running unnecessary cron jobs
			as this increases the load of the AppEngine.
