=== On the App Engine
		The process of creating an application on the Google App Engine
			involves the creation of an application on the Google App Engine
			website. Afterwards you can locally create a web application and
			upload this application to the created application on the Google App
			Engine. 

		
			To create an application on the
http://appengine.google.com/">App Engine</ulink>
			press the button
			"Create an
			application"
			and select an application name.
			You have to choose one which is
			still
			available. Remember this name
			because we will later use this in the creation of our demo
			application.

=== Running application locally
		
			The Eclipse Plugin allows to run applications for the Google
			App
			Engine locally in an environment which simulates the environment
			on
			the App Engine. You also have a local admin console which allow
			you to
			see your local datastore, the task queue, inbound email and
			XMPP
			traffic. You find this local admin console on
			"http://localhost:8888/_ah/admin/".
