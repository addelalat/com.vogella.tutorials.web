== Email handling
	 AppEngine allows your application to send and receive emails. We
		will use the receive email feature
		to be able to receive new TODOs via
		email.
	

	
		To receive emails in your application you have to declare that
		your application is allowed to use the mail
		service. Add
		the service
		"mail" to
		your "appengine-web.xml".
	

	
		<programlisting>
			<xi:include xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude"
				parse="text" href="./examples/mail/appengine-web.xml[]
----
	
	
			After redeploying your app you can check in the admin console of
			the
			appengine under Application Settings if incoming email is
			allowed.

		After defining that your application can receive email you need
		to
		define the email address for your application. The email address would be:
	
	
			<programlisting>
				<xi:include xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude"
					parse="text" href="./examples/email/address.txt[]
----
			
		
	
		
		This address follows
		the pattern: "user@domain". The domainis based on
		the applicationid,
		e.g.
		"applicationid.appspotmail.com".
		Please note that   string@appid.appspotmail.com
		 appspotmail.com is different from appspot.com, which we use in the domain name of our application.
		You can add use any
		user you want
		as long as you provide a mapping to a
		servlet in `web.xml`.
	
	
		Via
		the `web.xml` you define which servlet
		answers to which user.
		The url
		pattern must start with "/_ah/mail/" to
		tell AppEngine that this
		is a
		mapping for receiving emails. The url
		pattern can  include
		wildcards. 
	
	We will define that one servlet receives the email for all users.
		Add the following servlet
		mappings to your `web.xml`, make sure you
		replace the string
		"applicationid" with your real id. " 

	
		<programlisting>
			<xi:include xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude"
				parse="text" href="./examples/mail/web.xml[]
----
	
	 Create the following servlet which will process your email.
	
	
		<programlisting>
			<xi:include xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude"
				parse="text" href="./examples/mail/EmailServlet.java[]
----
	

	 To test your email functionality start your application and open
		the admin console on "http://localhost:8888/_ah/admin/". Select
		Inbound Mail and maintain some test data. Make sure the To email
		address match the servlet mapping for the email address. 

	 Deploy your application. Send an email to
		"whatever@applicationid.appspotmail.com". Login to your application.
		You should get a new Todo
		with the summary of the email header and the
		description of the email
		body.
