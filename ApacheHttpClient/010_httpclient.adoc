== Using the Apache HttpClient
	
The Apache
HttpClient library simplifies handling HTTP requests.
To use
this library download the binaries with dependencies from
http://hc.apache.org/
and add then to your project classpath.
	
You retrieve and send data via the
`HttpClient`
class. An
instance of this class can be created with
`new DefaultHttpClient();`
	
`DefaultHttpClient`
is the standard HttpClient and uses the
`SingleClientConnManager`
class to handle HTTP connections.
`SingleClientConnManager`
is not thread-safe, this means that access to it via several threads
will create problems.
	
The HttpClient uses a
`HttpUriRequest`
to send and receive data.
Important subclass of
`HttpUriRequest`
are
`HttpGet`
and
`HttpPost`.

You can get the
response of
the HttpClient as
an
InputStream.
