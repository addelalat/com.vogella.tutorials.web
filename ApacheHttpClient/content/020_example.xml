=== Project and Expectations
		
			The following examples do not necessary work out of the box as
			we do not
			provide the required backend for receiving the data. Think
			of the
			following as examples how to setup HttpClients. Download
			the
			HttpClient libraries from the Apache Website, you can download the
			"bin" package it
			includes all dependencies.
		
		
			Create a new Java project
			<wordasword>de.vogella.web.httpclient</wordasword>
			,
			and
			add them
			to the
			path of your Java project. We use the project for
			creating our
			tests.
