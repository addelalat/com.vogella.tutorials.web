== Using the Apache HttpClient
	
		The Apache
		HttpClient library simplifies handling HTTP requests.
		To use
		this library download the binaries with dependencies from
		http://hc.apache.org/"> http://hc.apache.org/</ulink>
		and add then to your project classpath.
	
	
		You retrieve and send data via the
		<code>HttpClient</code>
		class. An
		instance of this class can be created with
		<code>new DefaultHttpClient();</code>

	

	
		<code>DefaultHttpClient</code>
		is the standard HttpClient and uses the
		<code>SingleClientConnManager</code>
		class to handle HTTP connections.
		<code>SingleClientConnManager</code>
		is not thread-safe, this means that access to it via several threads
		will create problems.
	
	
		The HttpClient uses a
		<code>HttpUriRequest</code>
		to send and receive data.
		Important subclass of
		<code>HttpUriRequest</code>
		are
		<code>HttpGet</code>
		and
		<code>HttpPost</code>
		.
		You can get the
		response of
		the HttpClient as
		an
		InputStream.
