== Pagerank
	
Pagerank is the weight of importance for a webpage calculated by Google. 

The calculation process is not known and contains many factors
but the principle is simple. A web page is more important if other web
pages link to it. The more importance a web pages has (by inbound
links from other sites) the more important are outbound links from
this webpage.
