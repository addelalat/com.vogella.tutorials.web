== Memcache

	 Google provides on the Google App Engine memcache as a caching
		mechanism. 
	
		Memcache is a high-performance, distributed memory object caching
		system, primarily intended for fast access to cached results of
		datastore queries.
	
	 Similar to Bigtable it works similar to a map with key and
		objects. If the memory consumption of memcache is to big then memory
		will automatically released based on a Last-Recently-Used (LRU)
		strategy. 

	 Google provides an API to put something into memcache and to
		remove something again from memcache.
