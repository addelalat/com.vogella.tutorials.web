== Tomcat as HTTP Server
	
		contains also a HTTP connector which can be used
		to serve static HTML
		pages. The standard directory which will be
		served is below the
		<wordasword>Tomcat</wordasword>

		`webapps/ROOT`
		below the installation directory. Place static content
		into this directory.
	
	
		To allow directory browsing via Apache Tomcat change the
		`listings`
		parameter
		in the file
		`conf/web.xml`
		from false to true.
