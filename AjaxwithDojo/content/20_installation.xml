== Installing Dojo
	
		Download the "Dojo Toolkit" from
		http://dojotoolkit.org/"> http://dojotoolkit.org/]
		and extract the zip
		file. As of the time of writing this article the
		release of dojo is version 1.3.1. Rename the name directory to
		"dojoroot". Put this directory into a folder "web". 
	
	
	
		<tip>
			I recommend that you use the proposed folder names, this makes it
			easier to follow this tutorial. 
		
	
	
	
		The folder structure should
		look
		like the following.
