==HTML container via id and class

HTML allows to define sections via ´div´ containers. 
These ´div´ containers can be used to style parts of the HTML document differently.
For this purpose you can identify the div containers via id and class attributes.
		
An id must be unique in the HTML document while the class attribute can be defined for several HTML elements. 
CSS allows to style these elements via special selectors. 
div can also be identified by an id and / or by a class and can container other block elements.
		
The following rule applies:

.Styling div containers
|===
|Definition |CSS selection rule

|<div id="myid">Content</div>
|#myid {css rules....}

|<div class="myclass">Content</div>
|.myclass {css rules...}
|===

The following example demonstrate both usages. Create the file _stylesdiv.css_

include::examples/div/stylesdiv.css[]

Create the following HTML file to use the style sheet.

include::examples/div/DivTest.html[]

You can also select by position in the HTML document. 
For example ´td a´ only selects links which are within a table row.

You can also use other attributes for example the following will define certain styling for links which have been visited or over
which the mouse hovers. 
They will identify if you have a link already visited or if the mouse hovers over a link and will change the display of the link accordingly.
