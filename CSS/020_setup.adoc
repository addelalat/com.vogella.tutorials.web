== Docker installation and setup

Install Docker Toolbox from https://www.docker.com/. The installation is well described on the getting started page. 
For example https://docs.docker.com/linux/step_one/ describes the installation for Linux

Afterwards you can test you installation as described on the webpage:

----
sudo docker run hello-world
----

If you issue the command the first time, it downloads the hello-world image and start it.

To allow your user to run docker commands without the sudo prefix, configure a new group and add you user to it. 


----
sudo usermod -aG docker ubuntu
----

Afterwards you need to logout and login again. Validate that you can run docker commands without sudo.
----
docker run hello-world
----
