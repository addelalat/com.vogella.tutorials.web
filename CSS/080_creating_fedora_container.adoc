= Exercise: Creating an Fedora based Unix system with Git

To run a bash on the latest Fedara system, use the following command.

----
docker run -t -i fedora /bin/bash
----

This creates a docker container (if not yet present), start the Fedora system and runs a shell in this container. You can now install Git into this
container.

----
dnf install git
----
ex

Enter the `exit` command to exit your container and create a new container with the `docker commit` command. 
This command supports the -m and -a flags. 
The -m flag allows us to specify a commit message, much like you would with a commit on a version control system. 
The -a flag allows us to specify an author for our update.

----
# to get the container ID to use for the new image
docker ps -a
# create a new image
docker commit -m "Adds Git to Fedora" -a "Lars Vogel"  9b14523f9e23  fedorawithgit
