	<title>Positioning HTML elements with CSS</title>
	<para> CSS allows to setup element with fixed, relate and absolute
		positions. Relative is the standard and will change the distribution
		of the different text containers based on the available space. 
	</para>

	<para> Frequently you want to make sure that you boxes stay on a
		specific place. You can use postion:absolute for this. A block element
		with this style will be removed from the normal flow of the HTML page
		and will have a fixed space. For example: </para>

	<para>
		<programlisting>
			<xi:include xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude"
				parse="text" href="../examples/positioning/absolute.html" />
		</programlisting>
	</para>
	<para>
		If you want to have a element always on a certain position you can use
		the fixed position and
		will
		not move even if you scroll down the HTML
		page. </para>
	<para>
		<programlisting>
			<xi:include xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude"
				parse="text" href="../examples/positioning/csspositioning.html" />
		</programlisting>
	</para>
