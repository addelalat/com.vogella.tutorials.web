== Eclipse Web Tool Platform

The _Eclipse WTP_ project provides tools for developing standard Java web applications and Java EE applications. 
Typical web artifacts in a Java environment are HTML,  CSS and XML files, webservices and servlets.
Eclipse WTP simplifies the creation these web artifacts.
It provides runtime environments in which these artifacts can be deployed, started and debugged.

In Eclipse WTP you create _Dynamic Web Projects_.
These projects provide the necessary functionality to run, debug and deploy Java web applications.

Eclipse WTP supports all major web containers. 
This includes Jetty and Apache Tomcat as well as most Java EE application server. 
In this tutorial we use Apache Tomcat as the web container.

The tutorial describes the creation of Java servlets. 

[NOTE]
====
The usage of Java Server Pages (JSP) is outdated, other frameworks are used for the creation of web user interfaces.
